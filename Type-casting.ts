/* 
    * is used to convert one data type to another data type.
    * In type casting, the data types of objects are converted into required data types.
    * It is also known as type conversion.
    * Type casting is of two types:
    * 1. Implicit Type Casting
    * 2. Explicit Type Casting  
    *   * Implicit Type Casting: In Implicit type casting, the compiler automatically converts one data type into another without any user intervention.
    *     * Example:
    *    let num1: number = 10; 
    *   let num2: number = 5;
    *       let result = num1 + num2;
    *      console.log("The sum is: " + result); // The sum is: 15
    *   * Explicit Type Casting: In Explicit type casting, the user converts the data type of an object to required data type.
    *       Guide Function In TS 
    *   let num1: number = 10;
    *  let num2: number = 5;
    * let result = num1 + num2;
    * console.log("The sum is: " + result); // The sum is: 15
